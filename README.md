<b>Data science consulting project undertaken at Insight</b>

<p align='justify'>
The following project was undertaken during my time as a fellow at the <a href="http://insighthealthdata.com/" target="_blank"> Insight Health Data Science Fellowship Program </a>in San Fransisco. During the fellowship I consulted with <a href="https://constanttherapy.com/" target="_blank">Constant Therapy </a>, a brain rehabilitation app that uses clinically-proven tasks to improve ability across a variety of different cognitive domains. The following <a href = "https://github.com/ewidman/ct_project" target="_blank"> blog </a> provides an overview of the 3-week long data science project.</p>
